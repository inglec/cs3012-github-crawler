# GitHub Crawler

This project, hosted at https://inglec-github.firebaseapp.com gives the user a variety of information about their profile by querying the GitHub API.

The two main infographics suppied by the webapp are:
1) The size of each repository based on its number of commits.
2) A graph showing how the user is connected to their contributors, and how these users' contributors are connected.

This project was developed as part of the CS3012 Software Engineering module.

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is used to handle authentication and hosting, while [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is used to provide visualisations for the project.
